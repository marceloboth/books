# Take advantage of Ruby's smart strings

## Coming up

Ways to declare strings in Ruby:

```
single_quote = 'Stop she said'

double_quote = "Stop she said"

single_with_double_quote = '"Stop" she said'

arbitrary_quote = %q{"Stop", she said}

arbitrary_quote = %q("Stop", she said)

arbitrary_quote = %q<"Stop", she said>
```

double quote can interpolate by "#{}"

for longs multilines:

```
heres_one = <<EOF
bla bla
nal lan
sdsd sinpal
EOF
```
